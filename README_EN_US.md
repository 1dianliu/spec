Inspired by MCDR's gamemode plugin  
Author: 1dianliu  DevVersion: 1.21+(Report bugs to me)  
The data pack is adapted for English. Add it to the resource pack folder and set language to English (US)​​.  


------------------------------------------------------------  
Enter `/trigger s` to switch to spectator mode, enter again to return to the original location  
Enter `/trigger tp` to choose another dimension, invalid in survival mode when clicked.Clicking in survival mode will prompt that it cannot be used  
The data pack includes a spectator protection mechanism to prevent spectators from entering areas in the void where they can be hurt  
Turn off command feedback with `/gamerule sendCommandFeedback false`, but all command feedback will be gone (  
Original spectators can teleport other players, press 1 three times to see other players' heads in the hotbar, and use double-clicking numbers or the middle mouse button to teleport there  

Regarding dimension teleportation, between the main world and the Nether, normal 1:8 teleportation is possible; entering or leaving the End will teleport to the corresponding dimension at 0 64 0  

------------------------------------------------------------  
It can also be used below 1.21, but the author has not tested it.  
There shouldn't be any big problems with using it in multiplayer mode. You can install it on the server.  
Multiplayer can also use `/spectator` [Carpet-Org_Addition](https://github.com/fcsailboat/Carpet-Org-Addition) or MCDR's [gamemode](https://mcdreforged.com/en/plugin/gamemode) plugin, but the data pack still has limitations  

The advantage of the data pack is that it is easy to install and close to the original version; just place it in the datapacks folder under the map folder, whether compressed or not  
Find the map folder in `.minecraft\saves`, You can also select the map in the game and click "Edit-Open World Folder" to enter
